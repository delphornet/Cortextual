# Project Goal #

The goal of the [Delphor](http://delphor.net "Delphor") Project is to develop tools that support Intelligence Amplification, to provide these tools to network engineers to allow them to scale the collection and use of networking data - and build a global community of collaborators collecting and sharing networking data. *The complete project should allow a network engineer to use Cortextual components off the shelf to do this quickly, for any network they have access to.*

# Project Leadership #

The Delphor project is currently led by John Eberhardt (@JohnSEberhardt3), Rob Weiss (@3XPlo1t2), and Craig Parisot (@CraigParisot)
